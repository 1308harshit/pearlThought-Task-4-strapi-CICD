Task 1 
 
I completed Task 1 by installing the STRAPI app using the CLI. I successfully tested the application, signed up with new credentials, logged into the admin panel, and created a sample content type named Product I added a sample entry called Product through the admin panel .

Problem faced During Setup:

1) Issue with cloned Repository :

Initially, I tried cloning the STRAPI repository from GitHub. However, I encountered an issue where the (yarn develop) command didn’t work because the (package.jason) file didn’t contain the required ( develop )script.


2) Login issue in admin panel :

After setting up the application, I got stuck on the login screen due to a UI rendering issue in STRAPI . The page did not load properly.
Solution Applied:

1) Created a New SRAPI App via CLI:
Instead of using the cloned GitHub repository, I created a fresh Strapi app using the CLI. This ensured that all scripts and dependencies were correctly configured out of the box.


2) Resolve Login UI Issue:
When the login screen froze, I performed a hard refresh on the browser. This resolved the UI loading issue, and I was able to access the admin panel successfully.
